Simulations, Models, and Visualizations of Portland Fire and Rescue data

## Analytics Branch

This branch should contain all analysis to be done on PF&R fire data.  For the
moment, your final results should be in a Jupyter notebook.  As we progress
through the project and have a need to upload results into a table to be served
by an API, we will move that goalpost.
